Topic
--------
The goal is to enhance and improve the users ability to watch, follow, and track E-sports tournaments and information across various games. The key features would be to wrangle many features and sources of information for quicker consumption in a pleasant and easy service. One key design choice should be to not try to replace the communities that exist on other sites. Instead it should complement the E-sports experience.

Similar Systems
--------
* Teamliquid.net
Has a very comprehensive list of streams and good tournament coverage for several games. More of a community site and less of a service.
* reddit.com
Subreddits specific to each game have become the most popular
* gosugamers.net
This is community site that specializes in news

Target Users
--------
Fans of E-sports teams and players. Ideally the user will have a social media account or a twitch.tv account to authenticate on our service.

Plan for accessing intended users
--------
Distribution will be done through a single website that will be hosted on either a VPS or a deployment platform such as Heroku or OpenShift. Users will be able to sign up using a valid social media or twitch.tv account.
